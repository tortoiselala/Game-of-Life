# About

This is a practice code and there are still bugs about the problem of read threads being out of sync with write threads.

I will try to fix it(actually It had been fixed locally, sometimes It will be upload).



# Why is this game?



The charm of life games.



# Future

The issue of synchronization has been resolved, and the next problem to solve is how to make the interface click input valid(and mayde the interface can be more beautiful).
